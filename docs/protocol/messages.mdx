  'A message is a public update from an account. There are different kinds of messages like posts, reactions, or follows. They are signed by an account and stored on OpenRealm Hubs. A message is encoded as a protobuf, hashed with Blake3, and signed with an Ed25519 signature from the accounts signer.'

# Types of Messages 

1. Posts: General updates or announcements.
2. Reactions: Responses to posts or URLs, like likes or recasts.
3. Follows: Indicating a user follows another account.
4. Verifications: Confirming ownership of an Ethereum address.
5. UserData: Providing metadata about an account.

# Message Storage and Limits

Messages are stored on OpenRealm Hubs and are subject to storage limits based on the type of message and the rented storage units from the Storage Registry.

| Category      | Limit           |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Casts         | 5,000           |
| Reactions     | 2,500           |
| Links         | 2,500           |
| Verifications | 50              |
| UserData      | 50              |


# Ordering and Expiration

Messages include timestamps for display and ordering, though these are user-reported and not verifiable.
When storage limits are exceeded, the oldest messages (based on timestamps) are discarded, with the message hash serving as a tiebreaker.

# Specific Message Types

1. Casts

Definition: Short, public messages with text, URLs, and mentions.
Content: Can contain up to 320 bytes of text, two URLs, and five mentions.
Management: Operate on a first-in, first-out basis when limits are reached.

2. Threads

Function: Replies to casts form threads, with each reply referencing the parent cast's ID.
Structure: A cast without a parent ID is a top-level cast, while replies form a thread.

3. Channels

Channels organize casts by topics, similar to forums. A cast can denote a topic URI as its parent, defining the channel's scope.

4. Reactions

Function: Indicate a relationship between an account and a target (cast or URL).
Types: Likes or recasts, managed on a first-in, first-out basis upon limit exceedance.

5. Links

Function: Indicate following relationships between accounts.
Management: Operate on a first-in, first-out basis with a display timestamp for expiration management.

6. Verifications

Purpose: Prove ownership of an Ethereum address, using signatures from both the Ethereum address and the account's signer.
Standard: Utilizes the EIP-712 standard for signature requests.

7. UserData

Uniqueness: Only one message per type is retained; older duplicates are discarded.
