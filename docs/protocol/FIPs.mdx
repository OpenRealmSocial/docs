  'OpenRealm Improvement Proposals '
---

FIPs are a structured approach for proposing and agreeing upon modifications to the OpenRealm protocol. They draw inspiration from Ethereum's EIPs and Python's PEPs. The FIP process allows for proposals related to:

Procedural Changes: Alterations in the protocol's operational processes, such as release schedules.
Standards: Introducing or modifying standards, like URI formats for onchain assets.
Implementation Adjustments: Adding new features or making changes to the existing protocol.
