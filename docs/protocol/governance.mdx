title: 'Governance'
description:
  'OpenRealm adopts a governance model centered on "rough consensus and running code," emphasizing practical implementation and general agreement over formal voting processes or authoritative roles. This model operates as follows:'
---

# Change Implementation

1. Protocol devs, who choose to merge changes into hubs and contracts.
2. App devs, who choose to deploy those changes to their hubs.
3. Users, who choose the apps they want to use.

# Consensus Formation 

Consensus is achieved through the community's adoption or rejection of new code, rather than through formal voting or designated power structures. This approach encourages:

1. Action Orientation: Prioritizing practical steps and implementation.
2. Diverse Viewpoints: Welcoming different perspectives and ideas.
3. Decentralization: Maintaining a decentralized nature crucial for the protocol's longevity.

# Governance Structure

OpenRealm deliberately avoids:

1. Binding Voting Processes: To prevent rigidity in decision-making.
2. Official Roles or Veto Powers: To avert politicking and unnecessary power concentration.
3. Over-structuring: As it can hinder progress and flexibility.

# FIP Process

Most changes within OpenRealm are proposed, discussed, and implemented through the OpenRealm Improvement Proposal (FIP) process. This process is the primary mechanism for suggesting, debating, and adopting new ideas and modifications to the protocol.
