# Qname Resolver

The Qname Resolver contract validates usernames issued under the \*.qcast.id domain on-chain by implementing [ERC-3668](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668) and [ENSIP-10](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution). The resolver contains the url of the server which issues the usernames and proofs. It maintains a list of valid signers for the server and also validates proofs returned by the server.

# Invariants

1. Authentication: resolving a name always reverts without a valid signature.

# Administration

An `owner` can update the list of valid signers associated with the server.

# Off-chain Systems

# Qname Registry

The [Qname registry](https://github.com/openrealmsocial/qname-registry) is an off-chain server that lets addresses with an qid acquire a unique username. Requests are authenticated by way of a signed message produced by the qid's custody address.

### Assumptions

1. All event history from IdRegistry will be accessible via an OP Mainnet node.
2. OP Mainnet will not re-org after 6 confirmations are received.
