We recommend running Hub on an always-on server that has [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) installed. 

# Requirements

Hub can be installed in 30 minutes, and a full sync can take 1-2 hours to complete. You'll need a machine that has: 

- 8 GB of RAM
- 2 CPU cores or vCPUs
- 20 GB of free storage
- A public IP address with ports 2282 - 2285 exposed

See tutorials for instructions on how to set up cloud providers to run Hub.

You will need RPC endpoints for Ethereum nodes on L2 OP Mainnet, L1 Mainnet and L1 Goerli. We recommend using a service like [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).

# Install via Script

The install script is the simplest way to set up Hub. 

```bash
curl -sSL https://download.openrealm.social/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

*If you're using macOS, you'll need to have docker installed and running.*

Hub will be installed into `~/hub` and will be run via Docker in the background, along with Grafana and Prometheus for [monitoring](monitoring.md). If you have trouble with the script, try [installing via docker](#install-via-docker).

# Upgrading Hub

Upgrade Hub to the latest version by running

```bash
cd ~/hub && ./hub.sh upgrade
```

# Install via Docker

Hub can also be set up by running the docker image directly. To do this: 

1. Check out the [hub-monorepo](https://github.com/openrealmxyz/hub) locally.
2. From the root of this folder navigate to `/hub`
3. Generate your identity key pair with docker compose.

```bash
docker compose run hub yarn identity create
```

4. Create a .env file in `/hub` with your Ethereum RPC endpoints:

```bash
# Set this to your L1 Mainnet ETH RPC URL
ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL=your-ETH-mainnet-RPC-URL

# Set this to your L2 Optimism Mainnet RPC URL
OPTIMISM_L2_RPC_URL=your-L2-optimism-RPC-URL

# Set this to your Openrealm QID
HUB_OPERATOR_QID=your-qid
```

5. Follow the instructions to set connect to network into the section networks

6. Start Hub with docker compose in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up hub -d
``` 

Docker compose will start a Hub container that exposes ports for networking and writes data to `.hub` and `.rocks` directories. Hub will now sync with the contracts and other hub instances to download all messages on the network. 

7. To view the status of the sync and hub, follow the logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f hub
```

8. Follow the instructions in the monitoring instructions to set up Grafana and view your Hub's status in real-time.
