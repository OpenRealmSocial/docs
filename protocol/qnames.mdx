  'OpenRealm Name (Qname) System'
---

OpenRealm issues offchain ENS names under qcast.id, allowing users to register names like wvrld.qcast.id and use them as @wvrld in OpenRealm-compatible applications. This system involves a signed message from an account without an existing qname and is managed by the Qname Registry server and the Qname Resolver, in line with ENSIP-16 and ERC-3668.

# Qname Usage Policy

To deter squatting and impersonation, OpenRealm implements a usage policy for qnames:

1. Names linked to public figures or entities can be reclaimed (e.g., @google).
2. Names unused for over 60 days are subject to reclamation.
3. Decisions often need human judgement and are made by the OpenRealm core team. For example, if @elon is claimed and Elon Musk desires the name, the decision is based on the current userâ€™s activity level, content quality on OpenRealm, and the legitimacy of their claim to the name.

Qnames also have specific restrictions:

1. An account (qid) can only hold one qname at a time.
2. Qname changes are limited to once every 28 days per qid.

# Qname Registry API

It's a simple HTTP service that's responsible for issuing and tracking qnames. All Qname changes are recorded as a transfer.
Registering an qname is a transfer from qid 0 to the user's qid. Transferring an qname is a transfer from the user's qid to another qid. Unregistering an qname is a transfer from the user's qid to qid 0.

# Get Transfer History

To get a history of all transfers, make a GET request to `/transfers` 

```bash
curl https://qnames.openrealm.social/transfers | jq
```

It also accepts the following query parameters:
 - `from_id` - The transfer id to start from for pagination
 - `name` - The qname to filter by
 - `qid` - The qid (either from or to) to filter by
 - `from_ts` - The timestamp (in seconds) to start from for pagination

# Get current qname or qid

To get the most recent transfer event for an qid or qname, make a GET request to `/transfers/current`

e.g. To determine the qid of `@openrealm`, make the following call and use the value from the `to` field in the return value
```bash
curl https://qnames.openrealm.social/transfers?name=openrealm | jq
```

To determine the qname of qid `1`, make the following call and use the value from the `username` field in the return value
```bash
curl https://qnames.openrealm.social/transfers?qid=1 | jq
```

Both will return the same transfer object:
```json
{
  "transfer": {
    "id": 1,
    "timestamp": 1628882891,
    "username": "openrealm",
    "owner": "0x0x4E0514a30B7877a5a8105AA3794E8E7abc18Ee84",
    "from": 0,
    "to": 1,
    "user_signature": "0xa6fdd2a69deab5633636fdb430a54b21b27dff12676481532746ex5ca18cd84048488a98ca4aaf90f4d29b7e181c4540b3604a0721b928e50ffcd495734ef8471b",
    "server_signature": "0xb7xd1760f14eda0228e0b647ff15f45233526ced3b4ae07fcce06144473d32960d3253776e62f761363fb8137087193347763f4af831250a96f3885f3c2289c41b"
  }
}
```

# Register or transfer an qname 

To register a new qid, e.g. `wvrld`, first make sure the qname is not already registered.

Then make a POST request to `/transfers` with the following body:

```yaml
{
  "name": "wvrld", // Name to register
  "from": 0,  // qid to transfer from (0 for a new registration)
  "to": 123, // qid to transfer to (0 to unregister)
  "qid": 123, // qid making the request (must match from or to)
  "owner": "0x...", // Custody address of qid making the request
  "timestamp": 1641234567,  // Current timestamp in seconds
  "signature": "0x..."  // EIP-712 signature signed by the custody address of the qid
}
```

To generate the EIP-712 signature, use the following code:

```js
import { makeUserNameProofClaim, EIP712Signer } from "@openrealm/hub-nodejs";
const signer: EIP712Signer = undefined // Signer for the custody address (use appropriate subclass from hub-nodejs for ethers or viem)

const claim = makeUserNameProofClaim({
    name: 'wvrld',
    owner: '0x...',
    timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
});
const signature = (await signer.signUserNameProofClaim(claim))._unsafeUnwrap();
```
This is the exact same kind of signature used in the ENS UsernameProofs provided to hubs to prove ownership of an ENS name.


e.g.
```bash
curl -X POST https://qnames.openrealm.social/transfers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d \
'{"name": "wvrld", "owner": "0x...", "signature": "0x...", "from": 0, "to": 1000, "timestamp": 1641234567, qid: 1000}'
```

Once a name is registered, it still needs a UserData message to be sent to the hub in order to actually set the username for the user.
